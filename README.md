OpenSSL for iOS
===

I urge you to not use this project
---

I am not supporting this project anymore. I have removed precompiled binaries and releases.

OpenSSL is not a good choice for getting access to crypto primitives or for SSL/TLS networking in iOS applications.

Instead, you should use the iOS provided libraries.

The native iOS Security and Networking Frameworks will always be more up to date and receive regular security fixes as part of iOS upgrades.
